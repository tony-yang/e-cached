# e-cached
An experimental in-memory cache db

## Goals
A side project required a fast read/write layer. While there exist many open source in-memory cache systems such as Redis or memcached, I want to better understand how they work and how an in-memory cache can be implemented. I will implement this project using Go and Python 3. I consider this a great learning experience both in terms of understanding an in-memory cache and learning Go.
